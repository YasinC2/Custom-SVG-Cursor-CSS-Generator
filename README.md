## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Choose a shape**

   Start by selecting a cursor shape:

   * Pre-defined options: **Circle**, **Square**, **Triangle**, **Diamond**
   * Or select **Custom** to paste your own SVG path

2. **Customize appearance**
   
   Adjust the following styling options:

   * **Color** – Set the fill color of the cursor
   * **Size** – Control the overall scale of the cursor shape
   * **Opacity** – Make the cursor transparent or fully opaque

3. **Set cursor states**
   
   Define two cursor styles:

   * **Base State** – Default cursor used across most of the UI
   * **Hover State** – Alternate style used when hovering over links and buttons

4. **Set the hotspot**
   
   Choose the cursor’s active point using a **3×3 grid** (top-left, center, bottom-right, etc.) for accurate click targeting.

5. **Preview the cursor**
   
   Instantly see how your cursor looks and behaves across different UI states in the live preview area.

6. **Copy the generated CSS**
   
   When you're happy with the design, copy the generated css code.
